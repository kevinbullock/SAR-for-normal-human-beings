# SAR in simple terms
This is a summary of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in simple plain language and terminology. 

**Definition:**

SAR stands for Synthetic Aperture Radar. This means:
- Synthetic: artifical, not real or genuine.
- Aperture: (the actual definition of aperture is an opening, as a hole, slit, crack, gap, etc.)
- Radar: stands for Radio Detection and Ranging; a device for determining the presence and location of an object by measuring the time for the echo of a radio wave to return from it and the direction from which it returns.

**Applications:**
- for a miltary or government, SAR is useful for spying on other countries, for example identifying vehicles, ships and troop movement from another country, it could be an adversary or an allie. 
- useful for understanding the conditions after a major natural disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, flood or earthquake.
- geometry of the Earth
- detecting changes to the Earth's suface caused by water erosion, or even if a vehicle has driven across a homogenous surface like a field or desert.
