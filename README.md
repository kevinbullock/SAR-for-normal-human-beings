# SAR in simple terms
This is a summary of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in simple plain language and terminology. 

**Definition:**

SAR stands for Synthetic Aperture Radar. This means:
- Synthetic: artifical, not real or genuine.
- Aperture: in this context, aperture means the antenna that sends out a microwave signal (the actual definition of aperture is an opening, as a hole, slit, crack, gap, etc.)
- Radar: stands for Radio Detection and Ranging; a device for determining the presence and location of an object by measuring the time for the echo of a radio wave to return from it and the direction from which it returns.

**Applications:**
- SAR can be used for a miltary or government, SAR is useful for spying on other countries, for example identifying vehicles, ships and troop movement from another country, it could be an adversary or an allie. 
- SAR is useful for understanding the conditions after a major natural disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, flood or earthquake.
- SAR can be used to measure the geometry of the Earth, much like you would measure the size of furniture. 
- SAR can detect changes to the Earth's suface caused by water erosion, excavation, landslide, or even if a vehicle has driven across a homogenous surface like a field or desert.
- 1)Areas with a risk of landslide (metro/underground construction in a city)
2) infrastructures construction sites (bridges...)
3) monitor the integrity of costly infrastructures in the oil, gas and mining industries 
4) disasters preparedness or response: volcanoes could also be monitored to to try to model risk of eruptions. After an earthquake, you could measure the displacement of the surface for example.
